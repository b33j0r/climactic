A simple testing framework for running shell commands and \

NOTE: climactic is a Python 3 package

Features

* Pytest integration via an automatically registered plugin
* Aggregate tests recursively in a directory matching the \
pattern "test_*.yml" using the commandline tool `climactic`
* Compatibility with the standard `unittest` package
* Tests are run in a temporary directory to avoid data loss \
and path-dependent results
* Set environment variables per-test with the 'env' task
* Compare stdout, directory structure, and file contents to \
expected string values
* bash-like ${VAR} substitution for input commands and output \
validation
